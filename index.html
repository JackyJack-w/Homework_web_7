            Alright! <br>
            We're scanning the scene in the city tonight <br>
            We're looking for you to start up a fight <br>
            There is an evil feeling in our brains <br>
            But there's nothing new, you know it drives us insane <br>
            Running, on our way, hiding <br>
            You will pay dying <br>
            One thousand deaths <br>
            Running, on our way, hiding <br>
            You will pay dying <br>
            One thousand deaths <br>
            Searching <br>
            Seek and destroy <br>
            Searching <br>
            Seek and destroy <br>
            Searching <br>
            Seek and destroy <br>
            Searching <br>
            Seek and destroy <br>
            There is no escape and that's for sure <br>
            This is the end, we won't take any more <br>
            Say goodbye to the world you live in <br>
            You've always been taking and now you're giving <br>
            Running, on our way, hiding <br>
            You will pay dying <br>
            One thousand deaths <br>
            Running, on our way, hiding <br>

            Seek and destroy <br>
            Searching <br>
            Seek and destroyâ€¦ <br>
